# Jenkins User Notifier

This Plugin is used to Make a global notification for any Jenkins user.
It implements a Notification Bar that is visible at any webpage shown by Jenkins.

Features are that the time for showing the notification is limited by a configurable date
and that you can add translations to your notification so if your team of developers consists 
of people around the world you can give them native messages with a fallback langage.
